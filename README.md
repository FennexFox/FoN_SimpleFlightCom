# FoN_SimpleFlightCom
	The Simplistic Flight Computer, designed to work with brute force, to cut all the complexities of Orbital Mechanics down.

	When your crafts come with constant acceleration of 120m/sÂ² from the ground to the orbit, and packed with massive dV of 40,000m/s, you don't really need to optimize your maneuvers. Just up in the air and go full throttle.
	Sounds easy, right? If then why so many people fail to reach the station? Because this game practically has no UI to help you out. Yes, all it should do is nothing but tell you "This is the time, go full throttle" but it failed to do that.
	My goal with this project is nothing seriously more complex than prompting "GO FULL THROTTLE NOW" in various occasions.
